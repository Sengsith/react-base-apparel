## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SASS](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) - CSS Preprocessor


### What I learned

I learned about structuring my files with SASS and React. Even though this was a relatively small project, it was good practice.

### Continued development

I need to spend more time analyzing the design because I find myself struggling in the middle of writing up my CSS.
